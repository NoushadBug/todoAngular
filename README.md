# TodoAngular

It is my startup boosting app while learning angular.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
